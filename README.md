# Project: Basketball Scoreboard

A project where I designed the scoreboard for a basketball game. Following are the features of this scoreboard.

1) It records the points of the home team and the guest team.

2) You can click on the +1, +2 or +3 button to add a point.

3) You can reset the game by clicking the 'NEW GAME' button.

4) The team who leads will have its name highlighted.

5) The scoreboard keeps track of the number of fouls of each team and you can add a foul to each team using the button: 'ADD FOUL'.

6) You can manually set who has the possesion of the ball between the home team and the guest team.

7) You can Pause the game using the 'PAUSE' button and Resume the game using the 'RESUME' button.

8) The scoreboard also keeps track of the current period.

9) There is a timer of 12 minutes for each period.

10) The game ends at the end of the 4th period. At which point the scoreboard simply resets.
